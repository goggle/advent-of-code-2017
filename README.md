# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions for the ["Advent of Code" challenges 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017).

I use [go](https://golang.org/) as the programming language to complete the challenges. To execute the code, run
```
go run name_of_the_challenge.go < input
```
in the directory of the challenge.
